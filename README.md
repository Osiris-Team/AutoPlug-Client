## AutoPlug-Client | What can it do?
Well quite a bunch of things actually...
The most outstanding one beeing (probably), an automated way of updating your servers plugins.
Then there is some more stuff:
 - automated self updating
 - automated server software updating
 - automated, scheduled server restarting
 - automated, modularized backup creation
 - note that the tasks above are all performed before starting the server (in multiple threads, aka asynchronously)
